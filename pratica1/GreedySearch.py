"""
Greedy search: There are informations such as the straight-line distance to the city. So, basically, the algorithm's starting point sees the ramifications
(childs), like a tree, of this point. The closest to the destination is the chosen. It repetes until it finds the end (distance zero). 
OBS: Not necessarily this search finds the best (less cost, for example) path.

A* search: Utilizes the function f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
Let g(n), from Uniform Cost Seach, be the function that chooses the next node to expand based on the total path length from the start to the current node.
Let h(n), from Greedy Seach, be the function that makes its choice based on the heuristic estimate of the path length from the current node to the goal.
OBS: A* search always finds the best path because, even after finding a good path to the goal, it just stops when there are no change to find a better one.
